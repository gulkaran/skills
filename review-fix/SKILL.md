description: Verify review findings (from review.md and/or PR review comments), plan the smallest safe fixes, and - after human approval - implement each as its own commit, then post verdicts and resolve the threads on the PR so the review work leaves a trail of evidence. Use after self-review or when a PR has review comments to address.

# Review-fix

Close the loop on review findings with an auditable trail: every finding gets
a verdict, valid ones get a fix commit, and every PR thread ends with a reply
and a resolution — visible on the PR afterward, not just in a chat log.

Read first: `~/.agents/skills/_shared/config.md`,
`~/.agents/skills/_shared/topic.md`, `~/.agents/skills/_shared/style.md`.

## Preconditions

Resolve the topic. Load `design.md` and `decisions.md`. Gather findings from
`review.md` and/or the PR's review threads
(`gh api` GraphQL `reviewThreads` for unresolved threads, or the tracker
recipes' equivalent).

## Process

### 1. Verify every finding

Against the actual code, with `decisions.md` in hand:

- **Valid** — real issue; note severity and the smallest safe fix.
- **Invalid** — wrong, already handled, or a recorded deliberate deviation;
  note why, citing the decision or the code.

Never fix an unverified finding.

### 2. Plan and gate

Present a table in chat (style contract): finding → verdict → proposed fix →
estimated size. Merge-blockers first. **Wait for approval** of the plan; the
human may drop, defer, or adjust items.

### 3. Implement

- One commit per fix, message referencing the finding
  (`fix(review): <finding> — <what changed>`).
- Fixes obey the same rules as execute: don't weaken tests; a fix that changes
  behavior beyond its finding is drift — record or raise per the drift policy.
- Run the relevant tests; nothing gets pushed red.

### 4. Leave the trail

After pushing:

- **Valid findings:** reply on the PR thread with the one-line fix summary and
  the fix commit link, then resolve the thread (GraphQL
  `resolveReviewThread`).
- **Invalid findings:** reply with the reasoned verdict — citing the decision
  or code — and resolve.
- Findings that came only from `review.md` (no PR thread) get their outcome
  recorded in `review.md`.

Update `review.md` with all verdicts and outcomes. Log line in `_state.md`;
phase → `done` when the human confirms nothing remains.

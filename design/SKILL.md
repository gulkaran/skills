# Design

Turn the chosen approach into an implementation contract the human formally
approves: what will be built, how we'll know it works, and in what PR-sized
slices. Execution refuses to start without this approval.

Read first: `~/.agents/skills/_shared/config.md`,
`~/.agents/skills/_shared/topic.md`.
No production code changes — the only code written here is a throwaway spike.

## Process

### 1. Resolve the topic

Follow the topic protocol. Expect phase `designing` with `research.md`
present. If there's no research (a small, well-specified task), say so and ask
whether to proceed directly — the human's call, recorded in the log.

### 2. Prove feasibility

Identify the **riskiest assumption** of the chosen approach — the thing that,
if false, invalidates the design. Prove or disprove it with the cheapest
possible spike (a scratch script, an API call, a 20-line prototype). The spike
is **throwaway**: discard the code, keep the evidence in the design's
appendix. If nothing is genuinely risky, say so explicitly — don't perform
feasibility theatre. If the assumption is disproven, stop and return to the
approach conversation.

### 3. Draft the design

- **Behavior contract:** acceptance criteria per slice — observable behavior,
  not implementation steps. These later become the tests execute writes first.
- **PR plan:** choose the fewest PRs that keep the work coherent and easy to
  review. Start with one PR for a cohesive feature. Split only at a natural
  boundary with a concrete review, dependency, rollout, or ownership benefit.
  Infrastructure, backend, and frontend can be useful boundaries when they
  stand on their own; do not split by layer automatically. Explain why each
  additional PR belongs on its own. A medium feature should not become five
  or six PRs without strong reasons.
- **Implementation slices:** use small, verifiable steps within those PRs.
  A session, test step, or ticket does not automatically need its own PR.
  Order genuine dependencies and record which slices belong to each PR;
  keep tests with the behavior they verify. Note delegation opportunities
  in the artifact, not as extra PR boundaries.
- **Test plan:** core behaviors to cover — major coverage of the concepts that
  matter, explicitly not exhaustive micro-testing.
- **Deliberate deviations:** anything knowingly outside standard practice,
  called out here and appended to `decisions.md` so review phases have the
  context.
- No file-by-file pseudo-code walkthroughs; the contract is behavior and
  slicing, not an implementation transcript.

### 4. The gate

Read `~/.agents/skills/_shared/style.md` now, immediately before reporting.
Explain what will be built, how it will behave (with an example where useful),
why this approach fits, and any meaningful limits or trade-offs. Summarize the
feasibility result and PR plan in plain language; keep the full acceptance
criteria and technical evidence in `design.md`. Make every scope or behavior
choice needing approval clear in chat. Reread the style contract before
presenting a revised design after further work. Iterate until the human says
**"approved"** — explicitly. Denied or redirected means revise or return to
investigate; never proceed on silence.

### 5. Record

On approval:

- Write `design.md` (design + feasibility evidence appendix).
- Update `_state.md`: `design_approved: <date>`, phase → `design-approved`,
  branch name if agreed; log line.
- If the human wants the stack on the tracker, publish it via the `to-tickets`
  skill (it reads the same tracker recipes) rather than reimplementing.
- Tell the human the topic is ready for `execute`.
